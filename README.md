## Current Version

This is the R version of the 2023 edition of Sean Lahman's Baseball Database, http://www.seanlahman.com/.

* It now fully reflects the reorganization of data tables in Lahman's source,
the most notable was the renaming of the old `Master` table, to `People` in the
Lahman Database. 

The current database schema is shown in the figure below:

* A collection of vignettes has been added, illustrating various data manipulation
tasks and analyses to explore some baseball questions.  Try: `browseVignettes("Lahman")`

* In addition, the documentation
has been updated to use `dplyr` and `tidyr` tools for database manipulation and `ggplot2` for plots.

## Installation

For the current CRAN version, simply use:

    install.packages("Lahman")
