## Introduction


These vignettes serve a dual purpose:

* to introduce users of the `Lahman` package to the breadth and depth of the data, and a range of analysis and statistical methods that can be undertaken using the data in the package, 

* to introduce users to the statistical software **R**, but particularly to the modern use
in statistics and data science encapsulated in the `tidyverse` of R packages designed to
facilitate data input and manipulation and graphics.


## Contents

Vignettes completed to-date:


1. [Relationship Between Strikeouts and Home Runs](strikeoutsandhr.Rmd) -- This vignette looks at the relationship between rate of strikeouts and home runs from the year 1950+. This question was inspired by Marchi and Albert (2014), _Analyzing Baseball Data in R_. 

    + R packages demonstrated: [`car` (Companion to Applied Regression)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=car)


2. [Run Scoring Trends](run-scoring-trends.Rmd) -- Major League Baseball average per-game run scoring for each season since 1901.


3. [Team Payroll and the World Series](payroll.Rmd) -- This vignette examines whether there is a relationship between total team salaries (payroll) and World Series success.


4. [Primer for Full House Modeling](FHM-primer.Rmd) -- This vignette introduces the key ideas behind Full House Modeling, a framework connecting observed achievement to latent talent distributions. It walks through the statistical foundations and demonstrates an application comparing batting averages across eras.

## Further reading

A number of books and on-line resources use the `Lahman` package as material for the examples. These include:

### Books

Michael Friendly and David Meyer (2016) _Discrete Data Analysis with R: Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data_ (CRC Press). [DDAR Web Site](http://ddar.datavis.ca/)


Max Marchi and Jim Albert (2014) _Analyzing Baseball Data with R_ (CRC Press)

* the book makes frequent reference to the raw Lahman database files in CSV form; the `Lahman` package was relatively recent when the book was published, and authors make a brief mention of the package.
There is a [Baseball with R](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/) blog containing extensions
and other analyses.

David Robinson (2017) [_Introduction to Empirical Bayes_](https://drob.gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes) (published at [gumroad.com])

* the book makes extensive use of the package to explain "the empirical Bayesian approach to estimation, credible intervals, A/B testing, mixture models, and other methods, all through the example of baseball batting averages."
