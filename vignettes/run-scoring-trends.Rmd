## Run scoring trends: Sub-titles and captions with ggplot2


This vignette demonstrates how to create a plot (using `ggplot2`) showing Major League Baseball runscoring trends since the 1901 season.

First, we load the necessary packages: `Lahman` (containing the baseball data), `ggplot2` to create the plots, and the data carpentry package `dplyr` (note that `ggplot2` and `dplyr` are included in the `tidyverse` package):


```{r Setup, message=FALSE}

# package load 
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

#### Read and summarize the data

For this example, we'll use the data table `Teams` in the Lahman database.

Once it's loaded, the data are filtered and summarized using dplyr.

 - filters from 1901 (the establishment of the American League) to the most recent year,

 - filters out (using `!=`) the Federal League

 - after grouping by the year, summarizes the total number of runs scored, runs allowed, and games played

 - finally, calculates the league runs (`leagueRPG`) and runs allowed (`leagueRAPG`) per game 


```{r, message=FALSE}


data(Teams)


MLB_RPG <- Teams %>%
  filter(yearID > 1900, lgID != "FL") %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(R=sum(R), RA=sum(RA), G=sum(G)) %>%
  mutate(leagueRPG=R/G, leagueRAPG=RA/G)

```

#### A basic plot

You may have heard that run scoring in Major League Baseball has been down in recent years--or is it going back up? This is a perfect opportunity to visualize the date; what can we see in a plot?

For the first version of the plot, we'll make a basic X-Y plot, where the X axis has the years and the Y axis has the average number of runs scored.  With `ggplot2`, it's easy to add a trend line (using the `geom_smooth` option).

The `scale_x_continuous` options set the limits and breaks of the axes.


```{r, message=FALSE}

MLBRPGplot <- ggplot(MLB_RPG, aes(x=yearID, y=leagueRPG)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.25) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900, 2015, by = 20)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3, 6), breaks = seq(3, 6, by = 1))

MLBRPGplot

```


The way we would set the title, along with X and Y axis labels, would be something like this.


```{r message=FALSE}
  
MLBRPGplot +
  ggtitle("MLB run scoring, 1901-2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0, size=16)) +
  xlab("year") +
  ylab("team runs per game")

```



### Adding a subtitle: the function

So now we have a nice looking dot plot showing the average number of runs scored per game for the years 1901-2016. (The 2016 data is the most recent that has been added to the database.)

But a popular feature of charts--particularly in magazines--is a subtitle that has a summary of what the chart shows and/or what the author wants to emphasize.

In this case, we could legitimately say something like any of the following:

- The peak of run scoring in the 2000 season has been followed by a steady drop

- Teams scored 20% fewer runs in 2016 than in 2000

- Team run scoring has fallen to just over 4 runs per game from the 2000 peak of 5 runs

- Run scoring has been falling for 15 years, reversing a 30 year upward trend

I like this last one, drawing attention not only to the recent decline but also the longer trend that started with the low-scoring environment of 1968.

How can we add a subtitle to our chart that does that, as well as a caption that acknowledges the source of the data?  The new `labs` function, available starting with `ggplot2` version 2.2.0, lets us do that.

Note that `labs` contains the title, subtitle, caption, as well as the X and Y axis labels.

```{r, message=FALSE}

MLBRPGplot +
  labs(title = "MLB run scoring, 1901-2016",
       subtitle = "Run scoring in 2016 was the highest in seven years",
       caption = "Source: the Lahman baseball database", 
       x = "year", y = "team runs per game") 


```


Easy.
