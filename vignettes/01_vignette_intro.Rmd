## Introduction


These vignettes serve a dual purpose:

* to introduce users of the `Lahman` package to the breadth and depth of the data, and a range of analysis and statistical methods that can be undertaken using the data in the package, and

* to introduce users to the statistical software **R**.


## Contents

Vignettes completed to-date:


* [payroll](payroll.Rmd) -- This vignette examines whether there is a relationship between total team salaries (payroll) and World Series success.

* [Relationship Between Strikeouts and Home Runs](strikeoutsandhr.Rmd) -- This vignette looks at the relationship between rate of strikeouts and home runs from the year 1950+. This question was inspired by Marchi and Albert (2014), _Analyzing Baseball Data in R_. 


* [run scoring trends](run-scoring-trends.Rmd) -- Major League Baseball average per-game run scoring for each season since 1901.

* [team pitching summary](team-pitching-summary_dplyr-quo.Rmd) -- count the number of pitchers used by each team in a single season.

## Further reading

A number of books and on-line resources use the `Lahman` package as material for the examples. These include:

### Books

Michael Friendly and David Meyer (2016) _Discrete Data Analysis with R: Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data_ (CRC Press)


Max Marchi and Jim Albert (2014) _Analyzing Baseball Data with R_ (CRC Press)

* the book makes frequent reference to the raw Lahman database files in CSV form; the `Lahman` package was relatively recent when the book was published, and authors make a brief mention of the package.


David Robinson (2017) [_Introduction to Empirical Bayes_](https://gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes) (published at [gumroad.com])

* the book makes extensive use of the package to explain "the empirical Bayesian approach to estimation, credible intervals, A/B testing, mixture models, and other methods, all through the example of baseball batting averages." 

* the [blog introduction to the book](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/)
