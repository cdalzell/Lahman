Sean Lahman's Baseball Database
}
\description{
This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2023.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to
make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a
team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available
anywhere. 

This database, in the form of an R package offers a variety of interesting
challenges and opportunities for data processing and visualization in R.

In the current version, the examples make extensive use of the \code{dplyr}
package for data manipulation (tabulation, queries, summaries, merging, etc.),
reflecting the original relational database design
and \code{ggplot2} for graphics.

The main form of this database is a relational database in Microsoft Access format.
The design follows these general principles:  Each player is assigned a
unique code (\code{playerID}).  All of the information in different tables relating to that player
is tagged with his \code{playerID}.  The \code{playerID}s are linked to names and 
birthdates in the \code{\link{People}} table.  Similar links exist among other tables
via analogous \code{*ID} variables.

The database is composed of the following main tables:

\describe{
	\item{\code{\link{People}}}{Player names, dates of birth, death and other biographical info}
	\item{\code{\link{Batting}}}{batting statistics}
	\item{\code{\link{Pitching}}}{pitching statistics}
	\item{\code{\link{Fielding}}}{fielding statistics}
%	\item{\code{\link{Teams}}}{yearly team statistics and standings}
