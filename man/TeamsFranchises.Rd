# Which of the active Major League Baseball teams had a National Association predecessor?

# Notes: 
# - the National Association was founded in 1871, and continued through the
# 1875 season. In 1876, six clubs from the National Association and two other
# independent clubs formed the National League, which exists to this day.
# - the `active` field has "NA" for the National Association franchises
# - where appropriate, the `NAassoc` field has the `franchID` of the successor National League team

# using the dplyr data manipulation package
library("dplyr")
