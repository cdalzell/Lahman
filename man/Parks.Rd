    \item{\code{park.name}}{the name of the ballpark}
    \item{\code{park.alias}}{a semicolon delimited list of other names for the ballpark if they exist}

\details{
This dataset apparently includes all ballparks that were ever used in baseball. There is no
indication of the years they were used, nor the teams that played there.

The ballparks can be associated with teams through the \code{park} variable in the 
\code{\link{Teams}} table.
