## Test environments
* local Windows 11 x64 install, R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt)
* ubuntu 22.04, R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21)
* win-builder, R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21 ucrt)
* macOS (mac.r-project.org), R version 4.3.0

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs on win-builder (development or release)

The local Windows check gave 1 NOTE; this is expected because Lahman is a large annually released data package:  

> checking installed package size
>    installed size is  6.3Mb
>    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
>      data   5.5Mb
>[All data files were compressed using the maximum known compression `tools::resaveRdaFiles(outdir, compress="xz", compression_level=9)`]

Added `LazyDataCompression: xz` to the DESCRPITION file, which should prevent this on CRAN
